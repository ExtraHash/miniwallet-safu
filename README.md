# miniwallet-safu

the idea of this microservice is to have an isolated place where we can store enough information about the webwallet that we can reconstruct it completely in the event of catastrophic failure on the main webwallet server.

it is recommended to run this on a separate machine that is only attached to the main server through a private network (LAN)
